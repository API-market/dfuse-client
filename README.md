# dfuse JavaScript/TypeScript Client Library

A WebSocket and HTTP REST client library to consume dfuse API <https://dfuse.io> on EOS networks.

**Note** This library is the newest hottest version of [@dfuse/eosws-js](https://github.com/dfuse-io/eosws-js)
library. If you land here because your are using it, refer to the [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) file for how
to upgrade.

## Installation

Using Yarn:

    yarn add @dfuse/client

    # Use this command if you are using npm
    #npm install --save @dfuse/client

## Features

What you get by using this library:

- Full dfuse API coverage (REST & WebSocket)
- API Token issuance & management (auto-refresh, expiration handling, storage, etc)
- Automatic re-connection on socket close
- Stream progress management and auto-restart on socket re-connection
- Full customization power

## Quick Start

When targeting a browser (you will need a bundler like WebPack since we only ship ES5 modules files for now):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const { createDfuseClient, InboundMessageType } = require("@dfuse/client")

const client = createDfuseClient({ apiKey: "<Your dfuse API key here>", network: "mainnet" })

client.streamActionTraces({ accounts: "eosio.token", action_names: "transfer" }, (message) => {
  if (message.type === InboundMessageType.ACTION_TRACE) {
    const { from, to, quantity, memo } = message.data.trace.act.data
    console.log(`Transfer [${from} -> ${to}, ${quantity}] (${memo})`)
  }
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log("An error occurred.", error)
})
```

### Node.js

If you target a `Node.js` environment instead, you will need bring a `fetch` compatible
function and a proper `WebSocket` client.

You are free to use any compatible library respecting the respective requirements. To
make it simple, if `fetch` and/or `WebSocket` are available in the global scope (`global`),
they are picked automatically by the library. While polluting the global scope, it's the
easiest way to get started.

It's what the examples in this project do using respectively
[node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) and
and [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) for `fetch` and `WebSocket` respectively.

In the bootstrap phase of your application, prior doing any `@dfuse/client` imports/require,
put the following code:

    global.fetch = require("node-fetch");
    global.WebSocket = require("ws");

You can check the [Node.js Configuration](./examples/advanced/nodejs-fetch-and-websocket-options.ts)
example for how to avoid polluting the global scope.

### API

The full API reference can be found at https://dfuse-io.github.io/client-js/.

This site is generated by running `typedoc` on this repository. The full API
reference being rather exhaustive, here a quick index pointing to the most
important entities' documentation section that should be read to understand
the various part of the library:

are all private implementations not exposed.

### Examples

**Note** You can run the examples straight from this repository quite easily. Clone it to
you computer, run `yarn install && yarn build` in the project directory. Link the local
build so it's usable by the examples:

    yarn link               # Adds a symlink of this project to your global installation
    yarn link @dfuse/client # Adds `@dfuse/client` in this project's `node_modules` folder (global symlink)

Ensures you have an environment variable `DFUSE_API_KEY` set to your dfuse API Key value.
Then simply issue the following command (pick the example file you want to run):

    yarn run:example examples/basic/stream-transfers.ts

#### Browser Example

For the browser example to work, you need to edit the `browser.html` file:

- Edit the `browser.html` file to put your own API key, search for `apiKey: "<Paste API key here!>",` in the file.

Once this is done, simply double-click on the `browser.html` file (`open examples/reference/browser.html` on Unix/Mac system).

#### Basic

These are the starter examples showing a concrete use case you can solve using `@dfuse/client`
library. Those toy examples have low to no error handling, check the [Advanced section](#advanced)
for production grade details on efficiently use `@dfuse/client`

- [Check Balance (delta between fixed block and now)](./examples/basic/check-balance.ts)
- [Search Your Latest Transactions](./examples/basic/search-your-latest-transactions.ts)
- [Stream Transfers](./examples/basic/stream-transfers.ts)
- [Stream Global State](./examples/basic/stream-global-state.ts)

#### Advanced

You will find examples leveraging the full power library with all the correct patterns to
consume the Blockchain data efficiently, with strict data integrity and how to properly
deal with error and edge cases (like micro-forks!).

## Development

The best way to develop this library is through modifying and adding examples
to the project.

To run the examples, it's quite simple, follow these instructions:

1.  Install project dependencies so that you get development tools at the same time:

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

1.  Link the project inside itself, that will be necessary to correct run the
    examples which import `@dfuse/client`:

    ```
    yarn link
    yarn link @dfuse/client
    ```

1.  Start the build watcher so distribution files are always up-to-date. Forgetting
    to do that will prevent examples from picking latest changes you've made to
    source files!

    ```
    yarn start
    ```

1.  Last step is to add `.env` file containing the [dfuse](https://dfuse.io) API key
    required to run the examples. Create a file `.env` at the root of the project
    with the following content:

    ```
    DFUSE_API_KEY=Replace this with API key!
    ```

1.  Final check, let's run an example to ensure everything is working:

    ```
    yarn run:example examples/basic/check-balance.ts
    ```

### Publishing

First step is to update the change log ([CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)) by updating the
`## In Progress` header to change to `## <Version> (<Month> <Day>, <Year>)` (i.e. `## 0.11.11 (March 26, 2019)`)
and the commit that.

Assuming you have been granted access rights to publish this package, the command to perform is simply:

    yarn run publish:latest

This command will automatically perform a clean build followed by the execution of the full test
suite then a publish the package followed by a publish of the docs and finally push the commits
and tag to the remote repository.

#### Pre-release

If you want to publish a pre-release version not flagged as the latest so that people still pulls
the current stable version unless they opt-in explicitly, use the following invocation:

    yarn run publish:next

Does the same work as `publish:latest` but the docs is not published by this step.
