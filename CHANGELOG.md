# Changes (per version)

## In Progress

## 0.9.2 (October 31, 2018)

- On `get_actions` & `get_table_deltas` only has two params (data parameters & optional parameters) both as defined as Objects.
- On `get_actions`, `receiver` is now optional and defaults to the same value as `account`.
- The `get_table_deltas` request was renamed to `get_table_rows`.
